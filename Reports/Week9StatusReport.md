**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week, I focused on peer reviewing the ChoreCenter application. I also investigated possible means of scrapign the business description from Yelp.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** In my peer review, I proactively communictated with the team when faced with blockers in starting up the app on my local machine. I also tried to be very flexible with my working time, making myself available for PR reviews and general questions when my team was blocked. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I learned a lot about Android Studio, Gradle, and running a local flask server through the peer review of the Chorecenter app. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** Lots of configuration issues w Android SDK's, python versions, and .keystore files. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** none <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Implement biz description scraping
* **Goal 2:** Killer final release deliverable!

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I succesfully implemented the autofill Google Places search bar on the roulette page. I also spent a little more time building out the basic skeletal page for account. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** I definitely found that trying to do things as simply as possible helped my development this week. For example, I found that there was a React Native element for GooglePlacesAutocomplete which made implementation very simple and straightforward. There were a couple additional features that I wanted to implement with the search bar, so I also looked around for a lot of preexisting examples. While the original documentation for the deature is helpeful to look at, I also found that looking at examples could really supplement my understanding. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** Besides the (very niche) skill of implementing the GooglePlacesAutocomplete component, I did not learn too many new things this week. Through working with the GoogPlacesAutocomplete feature, and the component I constructed with it, I did learn how to use callback functions to pass props from a child to parent component. It was interesting to see just how many useful React native components are avialable to developers. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** The biggest challenge for me this week was syncing the GooglePlacesAutocomplete bar with the state of the Roulette page. I chose to make the search bar its own component which was a child of the Roulette (and soon to be Search) page. This meant that I had to pass data from the child component to the parent via a callback. This was somewhat difficult for me to understand, but after much trial and error I was able to accomplish my goal! <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** I do not currently see any blockers in my path. Although, based off of the demands of my other classes and working schedule at the moment, I am a little worried about time management once again. There are a couple bugs that I have been putting off for some time now, and I definitely need to get around to fixing those soon. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Squash all bugs assigned from peer review
* **Goal 2:** Finalize implementation of search bar feature
