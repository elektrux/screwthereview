**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week, I focused on peer reviewing the ChoreCenter application. I also investigated possible means of scrapign the business description from Yelp.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** In my peer review, I proactively communictated with the team when faced with blockers in starting up the app on my local machine. I also tried to be very flexible with my working time, making myself available for PR reviews and general questions when my team was blocked. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I learned a lot about Android Studio, Gradle, and running a local flask server through the peer review of the Chorecenter app. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** Lots of configuration issues w Android SDK's, python versions, and .keystore files. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** none <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Implement biz description scraping
* **Goal 2:** Killer final release deliverable!

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week was a much slower week in terms of code. I was able to fix a test that broke during linting since regular expressions no longer worked and got the proper implementation of the contact form for Netlify parsing, which closes out all of my current GitHub issues. I'll be switching focus to supporting work on the Account page and potentially assisting with other open issues that are popping up during peer review.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Our team has continued to communicate via text and Slack which has been helpful in knowing which development tasks and issues in Github are being tackled. I know we're all a bit tight on time and we've been able to communicate well about limitations this past week also. I also particularly like having our GitHub linked to Slack as I get a notification on my phone when a PR needs to get reviewed. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I discovered that Netlify has a workaround for parsing forms in a JSX app and followed a couple of online guides to set up the form so that it works with our app and our Netlify dashboard.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** My biggest challenge this week has just been a lack of time to work. I've got a lot of projects due for other courses which has made it challenging to carve out long enough blocks of time to work on code, especially with peer review this week as well. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None! <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Get a full implementation of the account page working (with LuLu)
* **Goal 2:** Support team members on open GitHub Issues to resolve bugs in preparation for final release.

**LuLu Pinczower** | Have fully functional autocomplete location search bars in Search and Roulette | May 20, 11:59 PDT
| | Squash all GitHub Issues assigned to me | May 22, 11:59 PM PDT

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I succesfully implemented the autofill Google Places search bar on the roulette page. I also spent a little more time building out the basic skeletal page for account. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** I definitely found that trying to do things as simply as possible helped my development this week. For example, I found that there was a React Native element for GooglePlacesAutocomplete which made implementation very simple and straightforward. There were a couple additional features that I wanted to implement with the search bar, so I also looked around for a lot of preexisting examples. While the original documentation for the deature is helpeful to look at, I also found that looking at examples could really supplement my understanding. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** Besides the (very niche) skill of implementing the GooglePlacesAutocomplete component, I did not learn too many new things this week. Through working with the GoogPlacesAutocomplete feature, and the component I constructed with it, I did learn how to use callback functions to pass props from a child to parent component. It was interesting to see just how many useful React native components are avialable to developers. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** The biggest challenge for me this week was syncing the GooglePlacesAutocomplete bar with the state of the Roulette page. I chose to make the search bar its own component which was a child of the Roulette (and soon to be Search) page. This meant that I had to pass data from the child component to the parent via a callback. This was somewhat difficult for me to understand, but after much trial and error I was able to accomplish my goal! <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** I do not currently see any blockers in my path. Although, based off of the demands of my other classes and working schedule at the moment, I am a little worried about time management once again. There are a couple bugs that I have been putting off for some time now, and I definitely need to get around to fixing those soon. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Squash all bugs assigned from peer review
* **Goal 2:** Finalize implementation of search bar feature
