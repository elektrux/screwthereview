**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week was a much slower week in terms of code. I was able to fix a test that broke during linting since regular expressions no longer worked and got the proper implementation of the contact form for Netlify parsing, which closes out all of my current GitHub issues. I'll be switching focus to supporting work on the Account page and potentially assisting with other open issues that are popping up during peer review.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Our team has continued to communicate via text and Slack which has been helpful in knowing which development tasks and issues in Github are being tackled. I know we're all a bit tight on time and we've been able to communicate well about limitations this past week also. I also particularly like having our GitHub linked to Slack as I get a notification on my phone when a PR needs to get reviewed. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I discovered that Netlify has a workaround for parsing forms in a JSX app and followed a couple of online guides to set up the form so that it works with our app and our Netlify dashboard.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** My biggest challenge this week has just been a lack of time to work. I've got a lot of projects due for other courses which has made it challenging to carve out long enough blocks of time to work on code, especially with peer review this week as well. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None! <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Get a full implementation of the account page working (with LuLu)
* **Goal 2:** Support team members on open GitHub Issues to resolve bugs in preparation for final release.

**LuLu Pinczower** | Have fully functional autocomplete location search bars in Search and Roulette | May 20, 11:59 PDT

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I succesfully implemented the autofill Google Places search bar on the roulette page. I also spent a little more time building out the basic skeletal page for account. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** I definitely found that trying to do things as simply as possible helped my development this week. For example, I found that there was a React Native element for GooglePlacesAutocomplete which made implementation very simple and straightforward. There were a couple additional features that I wanted to implement with the search bar, so I also looked around for a lot of preexisting examples. While the original documentation for the deature is helpeful to look at, I also found that looking at examples could really supplement my understanding. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** Besides the (very niche) skill of implementing the GooglePlacesAutocomplete component, I did not learn too many new things this week. Through working with the GoogPlacesAutocomplete feature, and the component I constructed with it, I did learn how to use callback functions to pass props from a child to parent component. It was interesting to see just how many useful React native components are avialable to developers. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** The biggest challenge for me this week was syncing the GooglePlacesAutocomplete bar with the state of the Roulette page. I chose to make the search bar its own component which was a child of the Roulette (and soon to be Search) page. This meant that I had to pass data from the child component to the parent via a callback. This was somewhat difficult for me to understand, but after much trial and error I was able to accomplish my goal! <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** I do not currently see any blockers in my path. Although, based off of the demands of my other classes and working schedule at the moment, I am a little worried about time management once again. There are a couple bugs that I have been putting off for some time now, and I definitely need to get around to fixing those soon. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Squash all bugs assigned from peer review
* **Goal 2:** Finalize implementation of search bar feature

## Team Member Reports: Rachel Ye
**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** Address github issues (implement back button and bootstrap sizing)
* **Goal 2:** Help Lulu with Google Places API

**Rachel Ye** | Address github issues | Next Monday  

&nbsp; 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I started two new branches, one for the yellow highlight for the distance and dollar buttons in the search page, and the other branch was focused on adding the back button to the Roulette page. I am still debugging both of the branches because they are not complete right now, so that is why I have not merged it into the main branch. The back button also involves modifying our react routes in order to add a 'history' component for route navigation.  <p> &nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** This week I was able to spend a significant chunk of time on the development compared to last week. I went through a lot of different StackOverflow posts and tutorials to figure out how to get the highlight button working. Currently, my state is toggling as active which is causing every button to turn yellow rather than the one that is clicked. I saw a tutorial that explained how to make an array of buttons change color when clicked so I may try that method instead. You just have to refactor the buttons as a map. I also reached out to my team members to help unblock me. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I learned a bit about React routes and history using router-dom. In order to make the back button work, I need to modify the routes in index.js, App.js, and Navigation.js and change the BrowserRouter to a Router that uses history. However it is difficult to refactor everything because I don't want to break our current code or structure of routes. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** It was tough trying to debug my problems and not making much progress with it. For the back button, I realized that the Result page url doesn't update to /result which is why the back button isn't currently working. I've also been stuck with button state for the yellow highlight so I have been trying to brainstorm alternative solutions that doesn't involve rewriting all my buttons into a map. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** I am not necessarily blocked but I am focusing more of my energy on figuring out button highlight and the new issue that has opened during peer review involving the $$$$ dollar button. I will revisit the back button later becuase it is a more complex issue and it involves structural changes to the code that we may not have time for. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Address the $$$$ bug that we got during the peer review.  
* **Goal 2:** Figure out how to make the yelow highlight only apply to the selected button on Search page.
