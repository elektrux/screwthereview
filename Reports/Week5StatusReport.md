### **Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This has been a very busy week for the team. Each member describes a lot of the small pieces that needed to come together in their individual report, but as a team we now have an Azure database and URL set up to view our application live. We also have the scaffolding to now allow each team member to work on development of MVP features in parallel.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Starting on development and setting up our infrastructure has required a lot of communication over the past week. Our synchronous team meeting on Monday allowed us to dive into the estimated schedule and really talk through what each feature page is going to include in terms of code. Particularly, I think our team has a better understanding gof how data will be passed through components and the individual API calls being made.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** We learned a lot about Azure over the past week as we looked through other potential platform options and utlimately went through Azure setup. None of us have much familiarity with React and we've also learned a lot about how a single page React app is structured. Each of us is also learning about the API that our code will be working with.   <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** Getting off the ground with development has definitely been a bit overwhelming for all of us this week! While we are able to start coding and test through localhost, our Azure URL is currently not built, which Kenzie will be debugging later this week to set up for beta release.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** LuLu will be utilizing our Azure DB in her code, which we still need to configure. We do have a Zoom planned Thursday to do so and integrate that into our code. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

### **Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Develop MVP features for Beta released by May 6, 11:59 PM to allow for testing 
* **Goal 2:** Practice clear communication and support teammates through development.

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I wrote the SW Architecture and Testing plan sections of our team's deliverable. I also Drew a mockup of our home screen and got started with setting up my dev environment. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Communication, communication, communication. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** Nuances between SW Design and Architecutre, why GCP Free Tier is subpar vs Azure, and how to create a data model diagram! <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** I drove from SD to Seattle this weekend! Which meant 0 hours to do school things! That was very long and not very fun, and catching up has been difficult. No team issues/challenges though - all good now :) <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Develop some cool code! (Landing page specifically)
* **Goal 2:** Start integration Auth0 into our app
* **Goal 3:** Connect w Savio to see if he has any pointers

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week has been very busy as we get the development of this project off the ground. Over the weekend, LuLu and I set up our Azure DB, Azure Web Services to deploy our website on a URL and Azure DevOps to allow for release pipelines. Second, I completed a final set of UI mockups that our team will be using and they are now located in our repository. Third, I tackled the estimated schedule, breaking down individual development and documentation tasks, sprints and due dates as well as the documentatoin plan. Finally, I am in the process of setting up a Trello board for our team for better communication of tasks and due dates. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Creating a meeting agenda has been really helpful in keeping synchronus meetings efficient. LuLu and I also spent additional time on Zoom working together on general setup, which was definitely much easier than working asynchronously. I also think that utilizing Trello and having an estimated schedule with due dates is going to help keep us accountable for the development timeline. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** This week was a lot of learning about Azure and how to set up a build pipeline that installs the correct dependencies. I also learned how to access our deployment logs so I can now check the status of any error messages we recieve during deployment. I also learned a lot about the React Router framework that is used to route to multiple pages in React while still maintaining properties of a single page application. LuLu actually used this documentation to set up the router framework and I will be using it to do some continued work on the navigation bar and footer styles. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** LuLu and I spent an incredible amount of time setting up Azure and pipelines to deploy our application. Since we are using the "free" plan to save the $100 Azure credit for later in the quarter, we have not yet been able to see the website as we timed out on our limit during setup. Personally, I feel a bit overwhelmed by how much I am going to be learning about React and Node.js and how quickly our features are going to be developed. Lastly, I think there was a drop off in team communication this week as everyone is incredibly busy. We were much tighter on deadlines and needed to set some new communications norms like using @channel in Slack to notify others of urgent messages, which was not being used before. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** I need to get my team documentation and resources on React Boostrap which we will all need to use in our code to allow for dynamic resizing between mobile and web platforms on Tuesday so we can really start development! <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Create "Resource" document for all team members to utilize during development
* **Goal 2:** Learn about React Bootstrap and design plan for integration into application
* **Goal 3:** Set up Trello Board for clearer communication about tasks & due dates

## Team Member Reports: LuLu Pinczower
**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** Coordinate with group members regarding style / design choices for the front end.
* **Goal 2:** Become more comfortable with our stack so that developement moves more smoothly.

&nbsp;  

**Team Member** | **Task** | **Due**
------------ | ------------------------|------------
**LuLu Pinczower** | Have all required packages and tools required to develop with React and Node.js | 04/22 11:59 PM PST
| | Refine my screen mockup and evaluate others | 4/20, 11:59 PM PDT

&nbsp;  

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I assisted Kenzie in setting up our Azure hosting site. I also spent some more time researching additional data that we may need to access for completion of our application. For example, we discovered that Yelp offers a JSON file that houses all business categories which will be very helpful in building out the roulette aspect of the application. I also built out the skeleton of our navigation system on the web page and found a basic "spinning wheel" template to base my roulette page off of. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Kenzie and I spent a lot of time meeting and going over the infrastructure and implementation of Azure. I definitely found the face to face (Zoom) communication very helpful in clarifying any questions. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** Throughout the process of working with Azure, I defintely learned alot about the build process of a Node.js application. I also learned alot about dependencies and how applications can be "packaged" together. I also learned how to use browser routers on React apps. Browser routers essentially allow a single page application to act as a multi page site. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** The biggest issue was definitely utilzing the build / deployment features on Azure. There does not seem to be copious amounts of documentaion on Node.js / Azure apps, so setup went pretty slowly. On top of this, we are just beginning development, and I still need to brush up on my Node.js and React knowledge. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** At this point, my main blocker is lack of a backend. We definitely need to expedite the build of our database so that we can succesfully complete all features of our application on time. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Start integrating API calls into our skeletal applicatin
* **Goal 2:** Begin building out backend / database infrasturcture

## Team Member Reports: Rachel Ye
**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** Finish up mockup and implement changes and feedback.
* **Goal 2:** Finish downloading npm and setting up my environment. Keep track of documentation steps so we can add it to the GitHub.

&nbsp;  

**Team Member** | **Task** | **Due**
------------ | ------------------------|------------
**Rachel Ye** | Download npm and track all the steps I took. Finish revisions for my mockup | 4/24 Sunday 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** I completed the documentation task and revisions for my mockup and homepage. I've been reading documentation and trying to get my react environment setup for the project. This week I also wrote the Software Design section and described the different components for our project.<p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Reading documentation online has been helpful. I have been referencing online tutorials to help familiarize myself with React, components, and making API calls. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I have been learning a lot about React. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** Some of my issues were downloading yarn and npm correctly so that it would actually run the application. I kept running into problems where it wouldn't actually start the application and my files wouldn't compile. Another ongoing for me was to learn about state and components in React because I'm working on creating my own UI elements for my search page. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:**  An issue I was facing was getting yarn to start my app properly but I ended up recloning the repo after realizing the yarn install commands wasn't enough. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Finish reading react tutorials and work on the search component page.
* **Goal 2:** Read the React documentation and make an API call. Create the keyword, location filter, price filter, and distance filter.

&nbsp;  

**Team Member** | **Task** | **Due**
