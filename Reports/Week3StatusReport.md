# Week 3 Status Report
**April, 14, 2021**
&nbsp;  

## Team Report
### **Meeting Agenda**
1. Receive feedback on MVP features and stretch goals from user perspective.
2. Discuss tradeoffs of maintaining database or utlizing API search.
4. Feedback on selected technology stack for Screw the Review

&nbsp;  

### **Previous Plans & Goals**
This is the first status report, so we have no previous plans and goals for the team or individual members. 

&nbsp;  

### **Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week, we completed the "Requirements & Team Policies" deliverable. This living document includes information about team member roles, features, initial use cases, team policies and an estimated schedule for tasks. The document can be found here: [Screw the Review: Requirements & Team Policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AdpmiG6Gi3a_kvq9dlz2P9KB4OZ5nPvZS9F1-CJdxzk/edit?usp=sharing). <p>&nbsp;</p> 
* **Successful Tactics:** One of the things that was successful this week was having synchronous Zoom meetings to discuss MVP and stretch goal features and the technoloy, tools and frameworks we will be using for our application. It gave us the opportunity to start firmly outlining our plans so we can hit the ground running with development. We have also established our workflow at these meetings and communication expectations for our Slack channel.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** As a team, we bring a really diverse background of skills, knowledge and software toolsets to this project. Each of us will be learning new tools and frameworks as we go this quarter. This week in particular, we are all getting familiar with the Yelp API and how we will be interacting with this in our application. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** So far, we have been off to a smooth start in terms of team meetings and establishing communication channels. Our main challenge was really narrowing down what we wanted as our MVP features and which should be stretch goals. Ultimately, we were able to cohesively decide as a team after utilizing one of our synchronous Zoom meetings to dive deeper into what we want our application to do. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** While we have more of a detailed plan for our frontend implementation using React, we need to weight tradeoffs for our backend implementation. Specifically, we are unsure if we should pursue using a relational database to store information from the Yelp API or directly call the API each time a request is made through our application. This is on our meeting agenda to discuss with Wilson this Thursday. <Description>

&nbsp;  

### **Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Finalize the software toolset and architecture for the backend and frontend
* **Goal 2:** Begin preliminary mockups of the user interface
* **Goal 3:** Get in the habit of daily asynchronous standups via Slack to support clear and open communcation.

## Team Member Reports: Luke LeVasseur
**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week, I met with the Screw the Review team for the first time! I got to know all our members and gained a deeper understanding of the desired app functionality from Lulu (who pitched the project). Deliverable-wise, I wrote the "Setup App" use case, Defined our project's non-functional requirements, and set up a daily standup reminder in the team Slack channel.<p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** In the early stages of any project, getting to a shared understanding of team skillsets and features is crucial. I tried to communicate proactively with my team through the whole week, be curious and empathetic towards their previous software project experiences, and ensure alignment by giving space for group members to share concerns during team meetings.<p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** This week, I learned about the Yelp API datamodel and the Auth0 API. I also learned how to effectively get a group to alignment on features early in a project without direct and diverse user input.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** I really really really need to get comfortable with programming languages outside of Java. I was not very helpful in discussions of software stack tradeoffs and need to keep exploring dif software options. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None :)

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Start thinking about what data we will want to store in our backend and how to best to store it schema-wise
* **Goal 2:** Support clear, proactive, and empathetic communication amongst team members

## Team Member Reports: Mackenzie Leach
**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week, I completed a use case for the "Requirements & Team Policies" document, formalized the description of Screw the review, MVP features and strech goals, and was responsible for the overall proofreading and formatting of the document. I created a Markdown template for our weekly status reports and added an internal document in our Google Drive for weekly meeting agendas, notes and the assignment of action items. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** <Description> I think that create meeting agendas with an estimated time that we were going to spend discussing each item helped keep our team on track to make our meeting effective. I also found that it was helpful to screenshare during group work to walk through how to edit status reports and the organization of our Google Drive and meeting agendas. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** The main thing I focused on learning this week was Markdown syntax as it is not something I have worked extensively in Github previously. I also learned a bit more about using Postman to explore the APIs we will be using for this project.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** The main issue I encountered this week is a lack of familiarity with some of the components we will be using for our application. I will definitely need to start reviewing some of the languages I have not worked in for a long period of time and learn more about the components of our tech stack I am unfamiliar with. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** While we have our core features, we haven't yet discussed the specific technologies and languages we are going to be using to implement the frontend of the application, nor what we want the user interface to look like. 

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Familiarize myself with the Yelp Fusion API using Postman
* **Goal 2:** Begin reviewing frontend technologies and languages (React)

## Team Member Reports: Josh Sherbrooke
**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I contributed to the completion of the Requirements and team policies document, helped hammer down architecture, and began investigation into design and mockups.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Heavy early investment in documentation helped team planning and software architecture conversations be efficient and nonrepetitive. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I learned a lot about the Yelp API, which I had never used before. Simple get requests can capture a vast amount of useful data from Yelp. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** None. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Create a mockup for group discussion.

## Team Member Reports: LuLu Pinczower
**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I began to explore possible data feeds to back our application. We decided to primarily rely on the API offered by Yelp. I also obtained the credentials and API Key to access their developer tools. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Every time I had an thought of an idea or concept that I would be interested in exploring in our application, I always made sure this was a reasonable request. This involved alot of referring to the Yelp API to ensure that we could filter by desired fields. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** While I did not learn any technical tools this week, I did familiarize myself with the Yelp API. In terms of group work, I learned it is extremely important to be clear in asking questions and giving responses, especially early on in the process of developing an application. If we are not all on the same page initially, development could be extremely problematic and inconsistent. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** The main issue that I encountered this week was organization. I found myself excited by the idea of additional features when I really should be focusing on laying a strong foundation for the application. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** The main blocker I am currently experiencing is a lack of outline for database implementation. We still have a lot of details to hash out surrounding what we want this to look like in terms of users and recommendations. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** pinpoint exact API calls that will need to be made. 
* **Goal 2:** create application skeleton with API key and credentials in place

## Team Member Reports: Rachel Ye
**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** For this week I focused on brainstorming and evaluating different use cases during our group meetings. I considered different edge cases and scenarios for how the different features in our application should interact with one another. I also began familiariing myself with the Yelp API which will be a core part of our application.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** I found it helpful that we gave each other constructive feedback when writing about the use cases. Another tactic that helped was being able to openly discuss questions such as figuring out the software toolsets over zoom instead of trying to communicate through slack or text. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** This week I did not learn specific new technical skills yet, but I am planning to play around with the Yelp API and Postman. Some of the languages we plan to use such as Node.js and React are langauges I haven't used since last year so I need to brush up on these. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** It was difficult to determine which features should be part of our MVP and which ones are additional features for when we have time. There are some features I was really excited about such as implementing a swipe feature on restaurants but we had to keep our time frame in mind. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** Currently I have a rough idea of what our frontend and backend will use, but we need to make the backend model more specific. I think if we create a database scheme or a ViewModel it will guide our tasks much better. I also believe we should create a mockup of the app soon to help us visualize what we will be coding. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Use the Yelp API to make a simple GET request. 
* **Goal 2:** Looking into mockup tools or blocking out a rough draft of the app on PowerPoint.
