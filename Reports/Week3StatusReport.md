## Team Member Reports: Mackenzie Leach
**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week, I completed a use case for the "Requirements & Team Policies" document, formalized the description of Screw the review, MVP features and strech goals, and was responsible for the overall proofreading and formatting of the document. I created a Markdown template for our weekly status reports and added an internal document in our Google Drive for weekly meeting agendas, notes and the assignment of action items. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** <Description> <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** The main thing I focused on learning this week was Markdown syntax as it is not something I have worked extensively with in Github previously. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** <Description> <p>&nbsp;</p>

## Team Member Reports: LuLu Pinczower
**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I began to explore possible data feeds to back our application. We decided to primarily rely on the API offered by Yelp. I also obtained the credentials and API Key to access their developer tools. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Every time I had an thought of an idea or concept that I would be interested in exploring in our application, I always made sure this was a reasonable request. This involved alot of referring to the Yelp API to ensure that we could filter by desired fields. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** While I did not learn any technical tools this week, I did familiarize myself with the Yelp API. In terms of group work, I learned it is extremely important to be clear in asking questions and giving responses, especially early on in the process of developing an application. If we are not all on the same page initially, development could be extremely problematic and inconsistent. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** The main issue that I encountered this week was organization. I found myself excited by the idea of additional features when I really should be focusing on laying a strong foundation for the application. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** The main blocker I am currently experiencing is a lack of outline for database implementation. We still have a lot of details to hash out surrounding what we want this to look like in terms of users and recommendations. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** pinpoint exact API calls that will need to be made. 
* **Goal 2:** create application skeleton with API key and credentials in place
