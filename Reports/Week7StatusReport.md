&nbsp; 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week's Beta deployment was a huge understaking for our whole team, myself included. I configured our new server repo to deploy w Heroku, added more request headers to our server endpoint, worked out some server testing kinks, configured eslint to enforce our style guidelines, recorded the beta presentation w the team, and implemented the Express middleware package on our server code.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Prioritization, priorization, prioritization! <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** Heroku deployment, Express package, testing a server w jest. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** I wasn't able to get to scraping the biz description yet, despite committing to it last week. I had too much other work on my plate to get ready for beta release. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None <p>&nbsp;</p>

**Mackenzie Leach** | Team Status Report W6 | 5/5, 11:00 PM PDT
|| Photoshop Roulette Title & Spinner for LuLu | 5/5, 11:59 PM PDT
|| Complete Development & Testing of Landing Page | 5/9, 11:59 PM PDT
|| Complete Development & Testing of Experience Results UI with LuLu | 5/9, 11:59 PM
|| Write Quick Start Guide with Luke | 5/10, 7:00 PM PDT
|| Code Review: Search Feature | 5/10, 7:00 PM PDT


&nbsp; 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** I finished both the landing page and abput page along with full UI test suites for both. I also helped out with finishing the Bootstrapping for the Search class and hardcoded some values for our location filter until we have the opportunity to use the Google Places API for geographic autocomplete. I wrapped up the Quick Start Guide in this repository and worked with Luke to updated the quick start guide in the server repository. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** We've definitely spent a lot of time communicating on Slack and texting each other this week which has been incredibly helpful. We set aside an additoinal two synchronous meetings this week to touch base and work together to resolve bugs as we encountered them. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** Testing in Jest is a lot more complex than I expected and it was really time consuming to learn how to test UI components. The documentation for Jest is also a bit lacking, so I'd like to learn about utilizing mocking to test out things like link functionality as opposed to just their presence on the page. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** I think time management has been my biggest challenge. I've put a lot off in my other classes to work on this application in the past week and will need to pivot and take a couple of days to catch back up before continuing to grind on this! <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None! <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Outline & draft the user and developer guides by May 17. 
* **Goal 2:** Verify the quick start guide for both repositories by testing it.

## Team Member Reports: LuLu Pinczower
**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** Continue reading up on JSON data injestion in Node.js applications
* **Goal 2:** Continue fine tuning front end of roulette page, and start working on results

&nbsp;  

**Team Member** | **Task** | **Due**
------------ | ------------------------|------------
**LuLu Pinczower** | Finalize category list for roulette | 5/6, 11:59 PM PDT
| | finish frontend development of roulette wheel | 5/6, 11:59 PM PDT
| | integrate roulette page with results page (API handling) | 5/8, 11:59 PM PDT

&nbsp; 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I completed 2 main tasks and fine tuned some of my previous UI work. Firstly, I successfully integrated the server and frontend. Both the search and roulette page can succesfully ping the server with a set of headers to receive a random experience result. I also wrote tests for both the roulette and result pages. On top of this, I had some additional bootstrapping that needed to be done to add site-wide consistency.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Communication was definitely key this week. Whenever I hit an obstacle that I knew a group member had experience in, I made sure to reach out and set up a meeting. For example, Kenzie helped me out with some of the Jest testing semantics, and Luke walked me through the basics of the server that he set up. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I have never made calls to a server via a React app, so I definitely needed to do a lot of research on that topic. Similarly, I have never written tests using Jest before. This week was definitely full of technical learning. I also learned how to parse a JSON string into an object that is more usable in our React application <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** My main issue encountered this week was integrating the frontend with the server. This definitely took a lot of trial and error that Luke helped out with a lot. In the end, we were able to succesfully instantiate GET requests, retrieving the desired result with limited headers. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** My main blocker right now is the limiting offering of location preferences on the roulette and search page. Ideally the user would have much more control over their location, but we will need to tap into more APIs to build this out. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Integrate more flexible user input for location
* **Goal 2:**
