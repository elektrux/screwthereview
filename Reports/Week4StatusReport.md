&nbsp;  

### **Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** Our main deliverable this week was our Git repository setup. This assignment left us with a substantial amount of bandwidth remaining, which we used to begin thinking about bootstrapping our software stack and to sketch out some lo-fidelity mockups. We also iterated on last weeks Requirements and Team policies deliverable to further address feedback. Finally, we have all created a revised set of mockups for our UI after a feedback iteration and will be using these to form a unified understanding of functionality and design moving forward. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Having explicit deadlines and meeting agendas helped us immensely in tracking our individual action items over the past week. Proactive communication also was beneficial in getting ahead of our blockers. We are also getting in the habit of using Slack standups on the days we don't meet, which is helpful to be aware of what team members are working on and what responsibilities each of us need to complete. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** All of us are working asynchronously to get more familiar with the software stack we plan to use. Also, npm init create-react-app is magical! <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** While we were happy to take on the challenge of creating mockups early in the project to help us define feature goals, we've been challenged to do so asynchronously. Following the diverge -> converge best practice of design ideation and development has been difficult. Furthermore, finding the right learning resources to help us get off the group with our app has also been tough. Lastly, we are noticing that we have different styles in communicating asynchronously and it can be difficult to keep everyone up to date with different resources and documents. To address this, a recap of action items is sent the day before meetings in our group's private Slack with direct links to the relevant folders and documents. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None right now! <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

### **Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Develop a timeline of action items for development through beta release on May 11 (estimated completion 4/22)
* **Goal 2:** Solidify feature list and UI through lo-fi mockups (estimated completion 4/22)
* **Goal 3:** Create final mockups for UI (esimated completion 4/30)

**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** Start thinking about what data we will want to store in our backend and how to best to store it schema-wise
* **Goal 2:** Support clear, proactive, and empathetic communication amongst team members

&nbsp; 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** Kenzie and I have developed a really strong co-working cadence on documentation projects over the past week! We've worked together on the Requirements and Policies Doc, submitting what I thought was a great summary of our plan for STR, as well as status reports for the team. Outside of docs, I was able to play with a few bootstrapping frameworks for our app (npm create-react-app is awesome) so that we have the skeleton of our cod ein place before starting implementation. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Proactivity is key! One of the biggest reasons I took 403 is because I was excited about building a software project from scratch, and a lot of the technical knowledge I need to obtain for our team to succeed is something that I just have to go out and look for. Being proactive in bootstrapping the app, understanding our APIs, and communicating with the group has been immensely helpful. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** In my quest to understand what the heck Javascript is, I've been working through a few React tutorials. I've also explored strategies for architecting our DB design in the coming weeks. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** Not too much this week - the only thing I can think of is the daunting challenge of finding actionable code samples and explanations that will provide value to our app through implemention. There's so much to learn, it's scary! <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Figure out how to make API calls from a React app (Maybe onClick() => request and render response)
* **Goal 2:** Solidify feature list and UI through lo-fi mockups

## Team Member Reports: Mackenzie Leach
**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** Familiarize myself with the Yelp Fusion API using Postman
* **Goal 2:** Begin reviewing frontend technologies and languages (React)

**Mackenzie Leach** | Proofread Requirements & Team Policies | 4/13, 11:59 PM PDT
| | Complete Team Status Report with Luke | 4/14, 11:00 PM PDT
| | Git Setup Deliverable | 4/20, 11:59 PM PDT

&nbsp; 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week, Luke and I wrapped up the changes to the Requirements & Team Policies document based on the feedback we got from our meeting last week. We also finished the Readme.md for our repository for the deliverable this week. Outside of documentation, I created a mockup for the search interface and experience results screen for my use case. Each of us has also completed a mockup of the homescreen so we can more formally decide on a final layout. Our goal is to actually use Figma to create prototypes so we are very clear on features and implementation details.   <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** I think utilizing Slack to send out quick action item reminders and having a set meeting agenda for our synchronous meetings was really helpful this week in using time effectively. Luke and I also communicate regularly about documentation and deliverables, and the clear communication has made it really easy to complete the deliverables. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** Outside of the MySQL relational database for our backend, I lack a lot of familiarity with the tools, framework and languages were going to be developing the project in. I've been working through React tutorials to get prepared to use it in development as well as reading about how to launch Node.js code on GCP, which is our eventual goal for development. Most of my learning over these next few weeks will really be centered around these tools! <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** To date, we haven't encountered any issues so far with teamwork or development. I think the biggest challenge personally and as a team is going to be finding examples and tutorials for Node.js and React to help us get our app off the ground since this isn't something any of us are experienced in. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None this week! <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Work through the CSE 331 React Guide and React tutorials by team meeting on Monday 4/26 
* **Goal 2:** Start prototyping the UI (mobile & desktop), estimated completion by Friday 4/30

## Team Member Reports: LuLu Pinczower
**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** pinpoint exact API calls that will need to be made. 
* **Goal 2:** create application skeleton with API key and credentials in place

**LuLu Pinczower** | Determine list of viable languages to use with API | 4/15 11:59 PM PDT

&nbsp; 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I completed a mockup of the "roulette" screen, independent of the suggestion that will follow from it. I also spent some time seeking out and sharing resources regarding the devlopment of web applications using React and Node.js.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** I was especially busy this week as I travelled and received the vaccine, but I still managed to finish all my tasks with successful time management. This mostly comes from setting aside a chunk of time to finish assignemnts instead of in little bursts. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I have some experience using React and Node.js, but I definitely needed a refresher. Thus, most of my learning was technical as I read up on the conceptual side of developing and application with our intended stack. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** I am definitely finding working remotely on a group project difficult. It seems as though there is always new information being shared on one platform or another and it is difficult to keep up with all of our tasks and communication. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** I am finding it difficult to produce a mockup of my screen without seeing the general style tendencies of my other group mates. I would consider this a blocker because it likely means that I will need to redo much of my design to ensure consistency across the application. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Coordinate with group members regarding style / design choices for the front end.
* **Goal 2:** Become more comfortable with our stack so that developement moves more smoothly.

## Team Member Reports: Rachel Ye
**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** Use the Yelp API to make a simple GET request. 
* **Goal 2:** Looking into mockup tools or blocking out a rough draft of the app on PowerPoint.

**Rachel Ye** | Call a GET request successfully from the Yelp API. | 4/16 11:59pm PST 

&nbsp; 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I foxused more on getting the mockup drawn correctly on notebook paper and implementing feedback from my team members. I drew out a layout of what I imagine the Experience page would look like from a web application format. I am also in progress with download node and npm onto my computer and getting the tools set up in my environment. I downloaded Postman and will probably experiment with the Yelp API this week. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Our group meetings are very productive because we have an organized agenda. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I am learning about node and node package manager and I plan to document my steps. I also plan to refresh my memory on GET requests and React. I hope to brush through a React tutorial to refresh myself on the basics. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** So far there are no issues. If I run into issues, I plan to reach out to my team members. The only challenge I have is to come up with an effective design for the home page of the application so that it is uniform and consistently themed with the rest of the features. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** So far I'm feeling good about the application but I'm worried that we have substantially more coding work to do without Josh on the team. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Finish up mockup and implement changes and feedback.
* **Goal 2:** Finish downloading npm and setting up my environment. Keep track of documentation steps so we can add it to the GitHub.
