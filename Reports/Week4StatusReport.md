**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** Start thinking about what data we will want to store in our backend and how to best to store it schema-wise
* **Goal 2:** Support clear, proactive, and empathetic communication amongst team members

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** Kenzie and I have developed a really strong co-working cadence on documentation projects over the past week! We've worked together on the Requirements and Policies Doc, submitting what I thought was a great summary of our plan for STR, as well as status reports for the team. Outside of docs, I was able to play with a few bootstrapping frameworks for our app (npm create-react-app is awesome) so that we have the skeleton of our cod ein place before starting implementation. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Proactivity is key! One of the biggest reasons I took 403 is because I was excited about building a software project from scratch, and a lot of the technical knowledge I need to obtain for our team to succeed is something that I just have to go out and look for. Being proactive in bootstrapping the app, understanding our APIs, and communicating with the group has been immensely helpful. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** In my quest to understand what the heck Javascript is, I've been working through a few React tutorials. I've also explored strategies for architecting our DB design in the coming weeks. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** Not too much this week - the only thing I can think of is the daunting challenge of finding actionable code samples and explanations that will provide value to our app through implemention. There's so much to learn, it's scary! <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Figure out how to make API calls from a React app (Maybe onClick() => request and render response)
* **Goal 2:** Solidify feature list and UI through lo-fi mockups

## Team Member Reports: LuLu Pinczower
**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** pinpoint exact API calls that will need to be made. 
* **Goal 2:** create application skeleton with API key and credentials in place

&nbsp; 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I completed a mockup of the "roulette" screen, independent of the suggestion that will follow from it. I also spent some time seeking out and sharing resources regarding the devlopment of web applications using React and Node.js.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** I was especially busy this week as I travelled and received the vaccine, but I still managed to finish all my tasks with successful time management. This mostly comes from setting aside a chunk of time to finish assignemnts instead of in little bursts. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I have some experience using React and Node.js, but I definitely needed a refresher. Thus, most of my learning was technical as I read up on the conceptual side of developing and application with our intended stack. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** I am definitely finding working remotely on a group project difficult. It seems as though there is always new information being shared on one platform or another and it is difficult to keep up with all of our tasks and communication. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** I am finding it difficult to produce a mockup of my screen without seeing the general style tendencies of my other group mates. I would consider this a blocker because it likely means that I will need to redo much of my design to ensure consistency across the application. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Coordinate with group members regarding style / design choices for the front end.
* **Goal 2:** Become more comfortable with our stack so that developement moves more smoothly.
