**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** The past few days have definitely been very busy. I wrote the developer and user guide wikis in our client repository and the and the developer guide for the server repository. I also got a GitHub issues template set up for easy bug reporting going into Peer Review next week. Lastly, I was able to close a GitHub issue where the images on the About page were rendering very slowly. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** I was out of town late last week but asked my teammates to take notes on feedback which was really helpful in getting caught up. I think as a team we've continued to proactively communicate and worked on integrating Slack and GitHub to make pull requests and code reviews easier. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I spent some time reading about the best practices in writing documentation this week as I was working on the guides. I've also learned a lot about linting over the past week as we've started using EsLint to enforce the Airbnb Javascript Style Guide. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** This is an incredibly busy time of the quarter and I have a lot of my plate with other classes and TAing, so I'm finding it a bit difficult to carve out the amount of time I'd like to have to work on development for this course. I'm very appreciate of LuLu for stepping up to help out with developing the Account page this week so I could focus on other classes and work. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None! <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Address open GitHub Issues for Landing Page
* **Goal 2:** Shift contact form to React Component

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week has been busier than I expected. I had not finished the auto fill options feature but I started researching how to do it instead. I have been looking into getting some of the git issues completed. I want to add a "back button" and fix the bootstrapping issues for the small phone screens. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Communication has been pretty important. I have been communicating with Lulu to figure out how we should get a Google Cloud API key for the Google Places API. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** This week has been a slower development week for me, but I will probably research more about the Places API and get that working for the options section.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** Time management has been really difficult for me this last week. I'm running behind in my other two classes and I've also been trying to wrap up my part time internship. We are all definitely starting to get burnt out so I know I need to be more intentional about finding time to grind out these last few features for our project. I hope to find time this weekend to catch up. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None at the moment! <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Address github issues (implement back button and bootstrap sizing)
* **Goal 2:** Help Lulu with Google Places API
