&nbsp; 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** While scraping descriptions still eludes me, I had a super productive week! I completed the server development guide, implemented true random selection of experience from the Yelp API, and added a "dev mode" feature to the client repo which allows it to communicate with a locally-hosted server. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** This week, proactivity was huge for me. Taking initiative on important tasks, like writing dev mode code, w/o overthinking the planning aspect was very helpful in keeping project momentum moving.<p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** When you make a new branch, MAKE SURE YOU"RE BRANCHING OFF MAIN. I accidentally branched off a sandbox branch Weds morning to merge a trivial .md file into the repo, but ended up adding my half-finished scratch work to the repo as well and needing to manually roll back my changes. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** Time - With the EOQ coming up, I feel more and more stretched to find time to get all my work done on a weekly basis. Holding myself accountable to my own schedule will be huge through the next few weeks. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** Nothing ATM. <p>&nbsp;</p>

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** The past few days have definitely been very busy. I wrote the developer and user guide wikis in our client repository and the and the developer guide for the server repository. I also got a GitHub issues template set up for easy bug reporting going into Peer Review next week. Lastly, I was able to close a GitHub issue where the images on the About page were rendering very slowly. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** I was out of town late last week but asked my teammates to take notes on feedback which was really helpful in getting caught up. I think as a team we've continued to proactively communicate and worked on integrating Slack and GitHub to make pull requests and code reviews easier. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** I spent some time reading about the best practices in writing documentation this week as I was working on the guides. I've also learned a lot about linting over the past week as we've started using EsLint to enforce the Airbnb Javascript Style Guide. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** This is an incredibly busy time of the quarter and I have a lot of my plate with other classes and TAing, so I'm finding it a bit difficult to carve out the amount of time I'd like to have to work on development for this course. I'm very appreciate of LuLu for stepping up to help out with developing the Account page this week so I could focus on other classes and work. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None! <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Address open GitHub Issues for Landing Page
* **Goal 2:** Shift contact form to React Component

**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** Integrate more flexible user input for location
* **Goal 2:**

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I had to fix a bug that occurred in the Roulette page following the integration of our eslinter tool. After I fixed that, I spent a bit of time building out a rough skeleton that will serve as the outline of the account page. Most of my focus has been on integrating the Google Places API and autocomplete feature so that we can have a fully usable search bar on the search and roulett pages.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** In terms of learning how to use and implementing the Google API, I found it very helpful to diligently read documentation. Often times I find myself jumping around and not completely understanding how certain tools work, so I really made an effort to read through and digest the subtelties of integrating the search bar. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** This week I mainly learned how to implement and interact with the Google Places API. There is actually a direct plugin for React native apps which was very helpful. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** My main challenge coming into the week was the Google Places API, but in all honesty it was much simpler to integrate than I imagined. I still need to sync it up with my component's states, but am hoping that should not be too large of an issue. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** I am not currently facing any blockers, except maybe time constraints. I believe I have the resources to complete my assignments, but just need to use good time management to make sure I complete them on time. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Close all GitHub Issues assigned to my name
* **Goal 2:** Finish Google API work

**Previous Plans & Goals**
* **Goal 1:** Auto fill the options for the location filter
* **Goal 2:** Toggle active status for the Price and Distance buttons directly in the code

**Rachel Ye** | Auto fill the options for the location filter | May 16 11:59PM PDT
| |  Toggle active status for the Price and Distance buttons directly in the code | May 16 11:59pm PDT

&nbsp; 

**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week has been busier than I expected. I had not finished the auto fill options feature but I started researching how to do it instead. I have been looking into getting some of the git issues completed. I want to add a "back button" and fix the bootstrapping issues for the small phone screens. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** Communication has been pretty important. I have been communicating with Lulu to figure out how we should get a Google Cloud API key for the Google Places API. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** This week has been a slower development week for me, but I will probably research more about the Places API and get that working for the options section.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** Time management has been really difficult for me this last week. I'm running behind in my other two classes and I've also been trying to wrap up my part time internship. We are all definitely starting to get burnt out so I know I need to be more intentional about finding time to grind out these last few features for our project. I hope to find time this weekend to catch up. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** None at the moment! <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Address github issues (implement back button and bootstrap sizing)
* **Goal 2:** Help Lulu with Google Places API
