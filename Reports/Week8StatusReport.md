**Progress & Issues**  
* **Tasks Completed:** This week I had to fix a bug that occurred in the Roulette page following the integration of our eslinter tool. After I fixed that, I spent a bit of time building out a rough skeleton that will serve as the outline of the account page. Most of my focus has been on integrating the Google Places API and autocomplete feature so that we can have a fully usable search bar on the search and roulett pages.  <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Successful Tactics:** In terms of learning how to use and implementing the Google API, I found it very helpful to diligently read documentation. Often times I find myself jumping around and not completely understanding how certain tools work, so I really made an effort to read through and digest the subtelties of integrating the search bar. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Learning:** This week I mainly learned how to implement and interact with the Google Places API. There is actually a direct plugin for React native apps which was very helpful. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Issues & Challenges:** My main challenge coming into the week was the Google Places API, but in all honesty it was much simpler to integrate than I imagined. I still need to sync it up with my component's states, but am hoping that should not be too large of an issue. <p>&nbsp;</p>
* **Blockers:** I am not currently facing any blockers, except maybe time constraints. I believe I have the resources to complete my assignments, but just need to use good time management to make sure I complete them on time. <p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;  

**Upcoming Plans & Goals**  
* **Goal 1:** Close all GitHub Issues assigned to my name
* **Goal 2:** Finish Google API work
