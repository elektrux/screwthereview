# **Weekly Status Report Instructions**  
Weekly status reports help to plan and reflect on tasks, and keep the staff and yourselves informed about your progress. Each status report must be a markdown file and must include the following two sections. The smaller subsections should be each about a paragraph or organized as bullet points.

&nbsp;  

**Team Report:** This will include a status update for your TA and an agenda for the project meeting. 
  1. **Previous Plan & Goals:** This should be an exact copy of the third section of the previous status report. It will be empty for the first status report. 
  1. **Progress & Issues:** This section will include what your team did, what worked, what your team learned, where your team had trouble and where your team is stuck.
  1. **Updated Plans & Goals:** This section will outline the plans and goals for the week. Any incomplete tasks from the previous week should be rolled over. This section may be done in bullet points. This subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. It should also include long-term goals to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond the next week.
